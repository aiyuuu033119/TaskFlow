   **Note:** ⚠️ Prisma integration was attempted and reverted. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Continue with mock data for MVP
   - Try simpler database solutions (JSON file, localStorage)
   - Consider serverless databases (Supabase, PlanetScale)

### 2. **Enhance current mock implementation** 🔧
   - [ ] Add data persistence (localStorage/sessionStorage)
   - [ ] Implement data export/import functionality
   - [ ] Add more comprehensive mock data
   - [ ] Improve performance with larger datasets

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements** 🎨
   - [ ] Create responsive design for mobile and tablet

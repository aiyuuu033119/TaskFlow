3. **Database Setup** - Core data persistence
4. **API Endpoints** - Enable frontend-backend communication
5. **State Management** - Handle application state
6. **Core Components** - Build main UI features

## 📝 Notes

- We've completed the project setup and development environment
- Next focus should be on styling infrastructure (Tailwind + Shadcn/UI)
- Database and API should come before UI components
- Keep commits focused and use the Git Flow model we've set up
